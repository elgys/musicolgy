the corpus is a corpus out of alot of rock bands we looked around for a few sources of what in that time was considered rock. so we choose around 5-6 most famous bands that made rock in that decade and did that from the 70's till the 20's so we have 25 bands where we take thiere whole discography. This will give us a good view of the rock landscape as well how it changes over time and how the bands go with these change of the field. Then we can also look at what there bands fill in diffrent sub-genere in rock and how we can diffrentie them in music styles same. 
With these corpus we hope we can find some intresting findings and can understand the field of popuair rock better then before. we also hope to see how diffrent bands influnce each other and that would be a intresting way to look. at the world of rock.
